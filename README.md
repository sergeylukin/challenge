# You Gotta Love Front End

Gulp powered project crafted with love on Macbook Pro in Israel in 2015 specially for
[YGLF challenge](https://github.com/YouGottaLoveFrontEnd/challenge).
Aimed to take 2nd place. Or 1st in the worst case scenario. Just kidding, of
course 1st place is the aim.


## Commands

Install [npm](https://npmjs.com) and [bower](http://bower.io). Clone the repo.

Run `npm install` and `bower install` from project root to get all the awesome
dependencies.

> Note that npm may install some packages that may be incompatible
> with lesser popular operating systems. I only worked on this project under
> `OS X Yosemite` but remember from the past experience that working under
> `FreeBSD`, for example, may require some manual tweaking in order to get all
> packages working.

To get started in dev mode, run `gulp` and modify files in `./app`

To prepare production ready build run `gulp publish`

In both cases `browsersync` will boot up for you to enjoy the builds in the
browser.
